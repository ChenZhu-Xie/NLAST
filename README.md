## Description
The Nonlinear Angular Spectrum Theory (NLAST) is the ultimate solution to calculate various nonlinear process with unprecedented both accuracy and efficiency.

In this paper, the NLAST solves the generation and linear diffraction of $\omega_3$ in SFG process simultaneously in just one step, by transforming the nonlinear convolution of fundamental waves in the spatial frequency domain down to the FFT-2D form.

## Running the code
Run any .py file, and one shall see the bloody truth.
